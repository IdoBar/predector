# predector

Predict effectors in your proteomes using the Predector!

# What's the plan?

The pipeline will run several common tools (and some less common ones) for effector candidate prediction based on protein properties.

We plan to include.

 - [ ] Signalp 3, 4, and 5.
 - [ ] TMHMM.
 - [ ] Phobius.
 - [ ] Deepsig.
 - [ ] Deeploc and possibly targetp.
 - [ ] EffectorP 1, and 2.
 - [ ] ApoplastP
 - [ ] LOCALIZER
 - [ ] Protein similarity searches against effector databases using MMSeqs2 and/or HHblits.
 - [ ] Protein structural prediction tools from the RaptorX toolkit, and comparison with
      structural features of known effectors.
 - [ ] Integration of existing experimental custom scores (e.g. RNAseq, Proteomics) to inform candidate weighting.

Ultimately, the pipeline should output a series of effector candidate clusters and scores to prioritise experimental functional characterisation efforts.

Also we intend to inject as many [Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(film)) references as possible because predector kind of sounds like predator.
